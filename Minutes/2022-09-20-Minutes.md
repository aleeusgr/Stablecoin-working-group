More due diligence around native solutions is needed as well as pursuing other ideas. The general concept is bringing a stablecoin to Cardano that drives the ecosystem forward, where in ideal case, the stablecoin itself should have an established social proof.
* In parallel the working group will:
    * Research DAI and PAXOS options: Analysis needed on technical requirements to understand feasibility and constraints. PAXOS is very compliance oriented.
    * What other Cardano native stablecoin solutions people in this call and outside of the call are building. Work together to bring awareness and collaborate with them.
