## Notes and Decisions

- What are the challenges Cardano Community are facing in terms of stablecoin?
- 2 ways to implement stablecoin: money transmitting license vs trust license.
- ability to KYC non-US people.

## Open Questions
1. an official way of displaying fungible tokens from multiple minting policies to be commonly fungible in wallets
2. is a minting policy that is more secure than a key-pair needed?
     - One idea is cold wallet generated minting validation tokens like Gimbalabs developed for oracles
     - One other idea is to have a multi-signature mint that includes an oracle to verify asset sufficiency on every minting transaction
3. "grey list" of UTXOs and/or wallet addresses that are suspected of being affiliated with criminal activity.
