Anzens: UI Testing.

I have a conflicting view on regulations in crypto, which mostly comes from the book Code 2.0 by Lawrence Lessig. In it, the topic of regulation is viewed in another angle: how computer code and law are similar, and how regulation by code changes the way people live.

I have an example of DeFi - TradFi bridges in front of my eyes: on p2p markets USDT sometimes trades at 1.2, if fiat payment is in Russia. About a million people left the country recently, many support their close ones or depend on support, and high demand drives profits for liquidity providers.
